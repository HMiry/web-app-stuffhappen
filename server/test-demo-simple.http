### Simple Demo Test (Manual Session ID Entry)

### Step 1: Create demo session
POST http://localhost:3001/api/game-sessions
Content-Type: application/json

{"theme_key":"university"}

### Copy the session_id from above response and use below
### Example: if response shows "session_id": 123, then use 123 below

### Step 2: Get next card (replace 123 with actual session_id from Step 1)
@session_id = 5
GET http://localhost:3001/api/game-sessions/{{session_id}}/next-card
Content-Type: application/json

### Step 3: Submit round (replace 123 with session_id and 10 with card_id from Step 2)
POST http://localhost:3001/api/game-sessions/{{session_id}}/rounds
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "round_number": 1,
  "card_id": 10,
  "user_choice_position": 2,
  "time_taken": 15
}

### CHECK CURRENT SITUATION - See all cards played so far
GET http://localhost:3001/api/game-sessions/{{session_id}}/rounds
Content-Type: application/json
### Step 9: Check final game status (should show "won" with 6 cards collected)
GET http://localhost:3001/api/game-sessions/{{session_id}}

### Step 4: Try second round (should fail with 403 for demo user)
POST http://localhost:3001/api/game-sessions/{{session_id}}/rounds
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "round_number": 2,
  "card_id": 15,
  "user_choice_position": 3,
